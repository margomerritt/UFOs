# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
A table is created to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. The table filters data based on certain criteria and was created using JavaScript as the primary coding language. The table can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape. The file data.js provided the data for this project. The data set contains information collected from UFO sightings and includes the datetime, city, state, country, shape, duration in minutes, and any additional comments for each separate UFO sighting. 

### Resources
* Datasource: data.js
* Software: JavaScript

The five criteria for filtering this table are: date, city, state, country, and shape. Users can use any combination of the filters. They can use just one filter at a time or up to all five filters at once for more specific results.
