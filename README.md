# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
A table is created to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. The table filters data based on certain criteria and was created using JavaScript as the primary coding language. The table can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape. The file data.js provided the data for this project. The data set contains information collected from UFO sightings and includes the datetime, city, state, country, shape, duration in minutes, and any additional comments for each separate UFO sighting.
