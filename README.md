# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
A table is created to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. The table filters data based on certain criteria and was created using JavaScript as the primary coding language. The table can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape. The file data.js provided the data for this project. The data set contains information collected from UFO sightings and includes the datetime, city, state, country, shape, duration in minutes, and any additional comments for each separate UFO sighting. 

### Resources
* Datasource: data.js
* Software: JavaScript

## Results

With the web app up and running we can now search for information about UFO sightings. The web page looks like this:

The five criteria for filtering this table are: date, city, state, country, and shape. Users can use any combination of the filters. They can use just one filter at a time for a more general seach or up to all five filters at once for more specific results. 

Filtering just by state can help determine which states have more UFO activity. After filtering the state to Florida we see that there are only ten UFO sightings in this dataset.

While Arkansas only has three sightings in this dataset.

Knowing which states have more documented UFO sightings can help fans and researchers determine how likely it is that there will be another sighting in that specific state.
